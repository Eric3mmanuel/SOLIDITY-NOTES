8.IMPORTING A CONTRACT FROM ANOTHER CONRACT 

In this lesson ,we will be using 2 contracts,to explain the concept of imports in solidity ,so create a file for each 

a).SimpleStorage.sol

```solidity
// I'm a comment!
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity 0.8.30;

// pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
// pragma solidity >=0.8.0 <0.9.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 myFavoriteNumber;

    struct Person {
        uint256 favoriteNumber;
        string name;
    }
    // uint256[] public anArray;
    Person[] public listOfPeople;

    mapping(string => uint256) public nameToFavoriteNumber;

    function store(uint256 _favoriteNumber) public virtual {
        myFavoriteNumber = _favoriteNumber;
    }

    function retrieve() public view returns (uint256) {
        return myFavoriteNumber;
    }

    function addPerson(string memory _name, uint256 _favoriteNumber) public {
        listOfPeople.push(Person(_favoriteNumber, _name));
        nameToFavoriteNumber[_name] = _favoriteNumber;
    }
}

contract SimpleStorage2 {}

contract SimpleStorage3 {}

contract SimpleStorage4 {}
```

b)StorageFactory.sol

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.30;

import {SimpleStorage} from "./SimpleStorage.sol";

contract StorageFactory {

    SimpleStorage public simplestorage;

    function createSimpleStorage() public {
        simplestorage = new SimpleStorage();
    }
}

```

Lets now explore imports in solidity

//The 'IMPORT ' keyword is not placed inside a contract code 
//It is used to import another contract into a contract
//The syntax is import "./nameofcontract.sol";
//meaning any changes made on the imported contract will be conveyed into the new contract.
//its also important to keep the version of solidity in mind when working with different contracts to avoid compilation errors

//now,incase an imported contract contains multiple contracts in it , and you would like to work with just one contract ,it would be more expensive to deploy 
//to avoid this we use something called 'NAMED IMPORTS' ,which specifies the contract which you would like to work with
//the syntax is import{nameofcontract} from "./nameoffile.sol";
//we can also import multiple contracts from another file
//e.g import {SimpleStorage,SimpleStorage2} from "./SimpleStorage.sol";

lets explore with examples

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity  ^0.8.19;



import {SimpleStorage} from "./SimpleStorage.sol";//This  SimpleStorage contract from SimpleStorage.sol


contract StorageFactory{

    //remember when we input a data type in a contract?
    //e.g uint256 public FavNo
    //the syntax of saving that variable is type ,visibility, name
    //we will do exactly that
    //the type will be : SimpleStorage 
    //this is because the same way in which a 'STRUCT ' keyword allows us to create a new type ,is the same way a 'CONTRACT ' keyword allows us to create a new type 
    SimpleStorage public simpleStorage; 

    function CreateSimpleStorageContract() public {
    //the question is ,how does StorageFactory contract know how Simple Storage contract looks like?
    //method1 : You can copy the contract code from the original contract and paste it on the other contract as done above
    //You are allowed to have multiple contracts on the same file .(THOUGH THIS ISNT THE BEST PRACTICE)
    //To avoid this you can use the 'IMPORT ' keyword to import anoher contract
    //e.g import "./SimpleStorage.sol";

    simpleStorage = new SimpleStorage();
    // the 'new ' keyword is how solidity knows to deploy a contract.
    }

}

//So ,once you've compiled and deployed your StorageFactory contract,you should click on the createSimpleStorageContract button on remix and then click on the simpleStorage button that appears.This deploys a new SimpleStorage contract ,and displays a new address,where you can now locate the SimpleStorage contract

/Another thing to keep in mind when deploying contracts from other contracts is the solidity version of both contracts .Having a mismatch e.g pragma solidity 0.8.26; on the first contract  and pragma solidity ^0.8.30; on the second contract might trigger an error

You can also use named imports to import multiple contracts:

import { SimpleStorage, SimpleStorage1 } from "./SimpleStorage.sol";
👀❗IMPORTANT:br
Try to always default to named imports instead of importing the entire file.

Conclusion
The import keyword allows a contract to use code from other files without including the entire codebase. However, it can introduce compilation issues if different compiler versions are used in these files.*/
