SOLIDITY DATA TYPES

Solidity supports various data types 
e.g 

Boolean (bool): true or false

Unsigned Integer (uint): unsigned whole number (positive)

Integer (int): signed whole number (positive and negative)

Address (address): 20 bytes value. An example of an address can be found within your MetaMask account.

Bytes (bytes): low-level raw byte data 

Variables definition

Variables are just placeholders for values. A value can be one data type described in the list above. For instance, we could create a Boolean variable named hasFavoriteNumber, which would represent whether someone has a favourite number or not (constant true or false).

example

```solidity 
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.19;
​
contract SimpleStorage {
    // Basic types
    bool hasFavoriteNumber = true;
    uint256 favoriteNumber = 88;
    string favoriteNumberInText = "eighty-eight";
    int256 favoriteInt = -88;
    address myAddress = 0xaB1B7206AA6840C795aB7A6AE8b15417b7E63a8d;
    bytes32 favoriteBytes32 = "cat";
}
```

The semicolon at the end of each line signifies that a statement is completed.
