3.SOLIDITY ARRAYS AND STRUCTS

//ARRAYS AND STRUCTS
//ARRAYS ARE A COMMON WAY OF GROUPING DATA 
//THEY ARE ZERO INDEXED
/*E.G 
[1,2,3,4,5]-ELEMENTS IN THE ARRAY
0,1,2,3,4  -INDEX
// STRUCTS (STRUCTURES IN FULL) ARE A WAY TO GROUP SEVERAL RELATED VARIABLES INTO ONE PLACE
//THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ARRAY AND A STRUCT IS THAT ,UNLIKE AN ARRAY , A STRUTURE(STRUCT) CAN CONTAIN MANY DATA TYPES E.G INT,BOOL,UINT ,ADDRESS ETC.
//EACH VARIABLE IN THE STRUCTURE IS KNOWN AS A MEMBER OF THE STRUCTURE
e.g struct person {
        uint256 personsfavnumber;-member
        string personsname;      -member
    }
//STRUCTS CREATE THEIR VARIABLES
//NOW YOU CAN CREATE A NEW VARIABLE AND ITS OWN ARRAY - person[]   
e.g person[] public personslist; 
//WE HAVE 2 TYPES OF ARRAYS 
i) STATIC ARRAYS - E.G person[3]
ii)DYNAMIC ARRAYS -E.G person[]

    person public person1=person('Eric',333);
    person public person2=person('Mona',69);
    e.t.c
    WE CAN JUST CREATE AN ARRAY

    THEN UPDATE IT USING A FUNCTION AS SHOWN BELOW

    //THE FUNCTION BELOW ADDS PEOPLE TO THE listofpersons ARRAY ABOVE
    function addpersons (string memory Name, uint256 Number) public {
        listofpersons.push(person( Name,Number));
    //NB-THE ORDER USED WHEN CREATING THE STRUCT IS VERY IMPORTANT
    /*NOW IF YOU WANNA ADD PERSONS TO THIS FUNCTION :
    -COMPILE AND DEPLOY THE CONTRACT
    -GO TO THE ADD PERSONS FUNCTIONS SECTION AND USING THE SEQUENCE OF NAME FOLLOWED BY NUMBER ,YOU CAN ADD A NAME AND ASSIGN A NUMBER TO IT
    E.G FIRST 
    ERIC,1000(then click add person)
    SECOND
    MONA,1000(then click add person)

    -THEN ON THE LISTOFPERSONS SECTION YOU CAN ACCESS THE ELEMENT OF ERIC USING THE INDEX 0,BECAUSE ITS THE FIRST ELEMENT IN THE PERSONS ARRAYS AND ARRAYS ARE ZERO INDEXED.
    -NOW ,YOU MIGHT BE ASKING ,WHAT IF I WANT TO ACCESS IN THE ARRAY ,USING A NAME INSTEAD OF AN INDEX NUMBER ,WHICH MIGHT BE TEDIOUS IN THE CASE OF A LONG LIST 
    //IN SOLIDITY ,ARRAYS CAN ONLY BE INDEXED WITH UNSIGNED INTEGERS(UINT256) BECAUSE THEY ARE LOW LEVEL CONTIGUOUS DATA STRUCTURES .
    // IF YOU WANT TO RETRIEVE VALUES USING STRING KEYS(LIKE NAMES) THE CORRECT DATA STRUCTURE IS A MAPPING ,NOT AN ARRAY
