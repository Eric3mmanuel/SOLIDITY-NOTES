    //the question is ,how does StorageFactory contract know how Simple Storage contract looks like?
    //method1 : You can copy the contract code from the original contract and paste it on the other contract as done above
    //You are allowed to have multiple contracts on the same file .(THOUGH THIS ISNT THE BEST PRACTICE)
    //To avoid this you can use the 'IMPORT ' keyword to import another contract
    //e.g import "./SimpleStorage.sol";

    simpleStorage = new SimpleStorage();
    // the 'new ' keyword is how solidity knows to deploy a contract.

//ONCE YOUV'E DEPLOYED THE CONTRACT,YOULL SEE THAT THE STORAGEFACTORY CONTRACT FUNCTIONS DO NOT APPEAR AT THE DEPLOYED CONTRACTS SECTION...THIS IS BEACAUSE , YOUVE SELECTED THE SIMPLESTORAGE CONTRACT AT THE CONTRACT SECTION (WHICH IS JUST ABOVE THE DEPLOY BUTTON).
YOU CAN JUST SWITCH CONTRACTS BY CLICKING THE CONTRACT SECTION AND SELECTING YOUR CONTRACT
