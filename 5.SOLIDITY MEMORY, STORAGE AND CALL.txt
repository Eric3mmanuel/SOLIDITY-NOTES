5.SOLIDITY MEMORY, STORAGE AND CALLDATA
Introduction
In this section, we will explore how Solidity manages data storage, focusing on the differences between storage, memory, and calldata, and why these concepts are crucial for writing optimized and secure smart contracts.

Data Locations
Solidity can store data in six different locations. In this lesson, we will focus on the first three:

Calldata
Memory
Storage
Stack

Calldata and Memory
In Solidity, calldata and memory are temporary storage locations for variables during function execution. calldata is read-only, used for function inputs that can't be modified. In contrast, memory allows for read-write access, letting variables be changed within the function. To modify calldata variables, they must first be loaded into memory.

🚧 WARNING:br
Most variable types default to memory automatically. However, for strings, you must specify either memory or calldata due to the way arrays are handled in memory.

```Solidity
string memory variableName = "someValue";
```

Calldata
Calldata variables are read-only and cheaper than memory. They are mostly used for input parameters.

In the following example, if we try to replace the keyword memory with calldata, we receive an error because calldata variables can't be manipulated.

```Solidity
function addPerson(string calldata _name, uint256 _favoriteNumber) public {
    _name = "cat";
    listOfPeople.push(Person(_favoriteNumber, _name));
}
```

Storage
Variables stored in storage are persistent on the blockchain, retaining their values between function calls and transactions.

In our contract, the variable myFavoriteNumber is a storage variable. Variables which are declared outside any function are implicitly converted to storage variables.
State variables are normally storage variables 


```Solidity
contract MyContract {
    uint256 favoriteNumber; // this is a storage variable
};
```

Strings and primitive types
If you try to specify the memory keyword for an uint256 variable, you'll encounter an error:
e.g
function addPerson(string memory _name, uint256 memory _favoriteNumber) public {
    _name = "cat";
    listOfPeople.push(Person(_favoriteNumber, _name));
}

> Data location can only be specified for array, struct, or mapping type

🚧 WARNING:br
You can't use the storage keyword for variables inside a function. Only memory and calldata are allowed here, as the variable only exists temporarily.

```Solidity 
function addPerson(string memory _name, uint256 _favoriteNumber) public {  // cannot use storage as input parameters
    uint256 test = 0; // variable here can be stored in memory or stack
    listOfPeople.push(Person(_favoriteNumber, _name));
}
```
